## Introduction
In today's world, college education is an important factor for social and economic mobility. However, the completion rates of college students are not always satisfactory. With the right tools and techniques, we can analyze the factors affecting college completion rates and help students succeed.

In this notebook, we'll be using Python to analyze a college completion dataset. We'll explore the dataset, clean the data, and perform statistical analysis to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. We'll also visualise the data using various graphs and charts to help us better understand the relationships between the different variables.

## Questions
We'll be answering the following three main questions based on the college completion data:

1. What effect do an institution's characteristics have on their graduation rate?
2. Does full-time faculty have an effect on student retention?
3. Which type of institution awards the most degrees?

## Data Source
The '**cc_institution_details**' dataset used in this analysis is obtained from data.world [here](https://data.world/databeats/college-completion/workspace/file?filename=cc_institution_details.csv).

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to use Anaconda, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook and the required Python libraries.

```python
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn random scikit-learn
```

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## File Descriptions
* cc_institution_details.csv - Dataset
* cc_institution_details_schema.txt - Dataset schema
* master_script.ipynb - Notebook to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook contains markdown cells to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps, which starts with data cleaning before looking at each question individually.


## Results
